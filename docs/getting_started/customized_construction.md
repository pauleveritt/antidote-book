# Customizing Construction

Antidote will construct your injected instances for you.
But sometimes you need more control.
Fortunately, Antidote gives you some hook points to specify the logic used for construction.

- Multiple flavors
- Move `!` from greeting to Config, to show injection in custom
- Multiple unit tests
