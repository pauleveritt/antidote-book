# Faster Dev with Tooling

Pluggable systems help you build bigger, better systems faster -- and frankly, more joyfully.
Antidote helps this through better testing and strong typing, and this book features both in its workflow.
Let's see how we can use the Python tooling of both to developer "in the flow."

## Fail Faster with Testing

Eat your vegetables.

Test-driven Development (TDD) positions itself as quality.
Write tests so you'll know your system works.
Your code will grow up to be a big, strong, healthy app.

What if testing was used just as a faster, "funner" way to code?
In a modern IDE, you can have your code on the left, your test on the right, and your test runner at the bottom.
You stay in the flow, using test functions as your way to poke around.
It's _really_ productive and actually kind of fun.

Let's add testing to our project.
