# Protocols

We just showed different kinds of `Greeter`.
Let's use `PEP 544 protocols <https://peps.python.org/pep-0544/>`_ instead of subclasssing.

In our little framework, define `Greeter` as a protocol, then change ``DefaultGreeter`` to no longer subclass `Greeter`:

```{literalinclude} framework.py
```

Also change our ``FrenchGreeter`` to no longer subclass from `Greeter`:

```{literalinclude} __init__.py
```

## Analysis

This is a small but important change.
Our implementations no longer have to use inheritance.
Instead, their structure complies with the structure of `Greeter`.

Why might you care?
What if you want to use a named tuple as the implementation, or an ``attrs`` class.
You don't want to have to subclass.
But if you don't, you're no longer a "type of" `Greeter` and Antidote gets made when using the nominal-typing approach.

With protocols, we're using structural typing and ``FrenchGreeter`` doesn't have to be a "type of" `Greeter`.
It just needs to be something that can be used the same as `Greeter`.
