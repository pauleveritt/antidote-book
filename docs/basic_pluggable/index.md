# Basic Pluggable App

Let's learn Antidote by gradually writing a simple, pluggable application.
Each example is fully-runnable code, with a small test, along with narrative documentation.

For the scenario, imagine a ``MegaStore`` chain of stores.
Each store greets customers as they come in.
``MegaStore`` provides a system for doing so, with defaults at the corporate level.
But each store can change some of the defaults, to make it more local to the area.
In fact, each greeter can personalize the greeting.

- ``App`` is what ``MegaStore`` provides to each store
- ``Store`` is what each individual store deploys
- ``Customer`` is someone who walks in
- `Greeter` is someone who meets the Customer
- `Greeting` is what they say to the Customer
- ``Config`` provides common settings such as the punctuation on the greeting

Clever readers might spot that this parallels web applications:

- ``App`` is a framework
- ``Store`` is a site that uses that framework
- ``Customer`` is an HTTP request
- `Greeter` is a view
- `Greeting` is a response

The only thing missing is ``Plugin``, where third-parties can distribute cool stuff atop the framework, consumed and customized by a site.
