# Datclasses

We can write our injectables as dataclasses.
This can help reduce class-writing boilerplate in all the dataclass-y ways.

```{literalinclude} __init__.py
```

## Analysis

You'll find some times `where things don't work as expected <https://github.com/Finistere/antidote/issues/39>`_ on dataclass fields.
The reasons though are easy-to-understand and work around.
It's possible that dataclass fields provide extra developer productivity for Antidote in the future.
