# TODO

## Now

## Next

- Sybil etc. for docstring-based storytelling
- Start each chapter with a context-free example done with a doctest
- Re-invent test writing to provide alternates passed in for injection
  - Rather than use a world all the time
  - Have a local function in the test
    - Which has an assert itself
- Get coverage up

## Soon

- More comments on included code
- Write good docstrings
- Get "Hello Kevin, my name is" customer.name in earlier
- Fix any cut-and-paste docstring violations
- Constantly remind people that civilians won't write this, they will consume it
  - You're giving them well-managed, domain-specific entities
- In singletons, introduce debugger to prove it only runs once
- In first usage of `world.get[Something](Something)` clarify the double usage

## Later

- Emphasize typing with `mypy` and IDE screenshots
- Each example module is in the api docs and can be linked to via "Files:"
- Clean out top README
- Clean out unused top-level docs
- Add ref targets in Antidote Sphinx docs

## Done

- Organize outline
- Decide on the `main` and `test` function ideas
- GreeterT when cast appears
- Move the cast thing to a top-level "const" and re-use
- Get rid of **init**.py for all components to ease changing files
