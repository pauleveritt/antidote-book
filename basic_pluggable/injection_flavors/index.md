# Injection Flavors

The first example used `inject.me` to state a dependency.
Let's see a number of other syntaxes for doing so.

```{literalinclude} __init__.py
```


We can see this in use in the second test:

```{literalinclude} test_injection_flavors.py
```

## Analysis
This is really straight from the docs so we won't talk too much about it.
The `Inject[Greeter]` syntax is particularly attractive.

It's worth looking at the pattern represented in `optional_greeter`.
Usually if an injectable isn't registered, the application will exit at startup time.
Marking it as optional allows a value of `None` if nothing was registered.
