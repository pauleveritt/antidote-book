# Factories

Sometimes your code uses a class that you don't control, for example from an installed library.
For example, some file `library.py` might provide your `Greeting` class:

```{literalinclude} library.py
```

You can't sprinkle the Antidote magic on it without forking it.
Instead, you can use register an Antidote "@factory" to mediate:

```{literalinclude} __init__.py
```


`Greeter` now says, during injection, where to get the `Greeting` from.
Our factory function does the glue to Antidote, getting the config information and passing to the "foreign" class.

## Analysis
Antidote looks at the *return type* of the function, then registers the factory for that type -- in this case, `Greeting`.

As Antidote's :doc:`antidote:tutorial` docs show, there's a good bit going on with factories.
The simple case is simple and convenient, but you have some more options available.

Like `@injectable`, the factory instance is by default a singleton.
This can be changed with the same ``singleton=False`` decorator argument.

There might be cases where you want to use a factory function even for injectable classes under your own control.
Then again, Antidote provides a number of protocols to control injectable creation, directly on the class, with resorting to a separate factory function.
